Obtained data on Bitcoin transactions sourced from Elliptic in conjuction with Cornell University:
 - Used Social Network Analysis in creating graphspace for the transactions. 
 - Then applied ML models to classify transactions as illicit or licit; 
 - Finally combined graphspace embeddings along with Neural Networks to create a Graphical Convolutional Network (GCN) to further elaborate on the classification
